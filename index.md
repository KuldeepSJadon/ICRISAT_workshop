# Training Progamme UASB & ICRISAT
 
## Two Day Introduction to Using R for Mapping and Modelling Plant Disease

**Instructor:** A/Prof Adam H. Sparks, University of Southern Queensland

**Dates:** 24 and 25 Aug. 2020

## Topics to be Covered

*A one-day introduction to R for non-programmers using gapminder data*

The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to write modular code
and best practices for using R for data analysis.
R is commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis and its array of third-party
packages.
We find that many scientists who come to Software Carpentry workshops use R and want to learn more. The emphasis of these materials is to give attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of R, and to teach best practices for scientific computing: breaking down analyses into modular units, task automation, and encapsulation.

Note that this workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the programming language R in day one.
Day 2 will have some exercises with fitting and evaluating models followed by working with spatial data and interpreting model output.

A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop.
These are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their usability.

> ## Prerequisites
> 
> Have the latest versions of both [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed on your own computer.
>
> Understand that computers store data and instructions (programs, scripts etc.) in files.
> Files are organised in directories (folders).
> Know how to access files not in the working directory by specifying the path.
> 
> Understand basic frequentist statistical ideas, e.g. *P-values* and linear modelling.
